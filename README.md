# Near-Field Channel Modeling

## Overview
This python package simualtes parameter extraction for
near-field channel modeling.  We use the reflection
model of [HYR+23] where each path of the channel is 
modeled by the image point of the transmitter.
Hence, the channel modeling problem is to extract
the locations of the image points and the path gains
from each image point.
